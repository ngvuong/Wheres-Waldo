## Techonologies and key concepts

Using React to quickly bootstrap this project, a great deal of care was put into devising the main structure and approach. Further opportunities to practice with the main hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useContext were abundant. Hurdles including appropriate state and props management proved to be challenging and rewarding. Applying styled components seems to have helped with the overall workflow. Firebase was also enjoyable to use as a new technology for the backend. Main struggles reside in the initial stages figuring out how to approach tagging character positions as to be consistent across screen sizes.
